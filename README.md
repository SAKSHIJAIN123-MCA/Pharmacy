This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Site Blocked in India?

If this site/link (https://rabhasenterprises.com/) appears blocked when accessing from India, you can try using the **Browsec VPN** extension in Chrome to open it.

### Steps (Chrome):
1. Open Google Chrome.  
2. Go to the Chrome Web Store (or open `chrome://extensions` → click “Open Chrome Web Store”).  
3. Search for **Browsec VPN**.  
4. Select the “Browsec VPN” extension and click **Add to Chrome** (or **Add extension**).  
5. Click the Browsec icon, enable it, and choose a non-Indian location (e.g., Netherlands / USA).  
6. Now open the site again — if the block is location-based, it should load.
